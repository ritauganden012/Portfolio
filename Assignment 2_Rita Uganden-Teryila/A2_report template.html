				Property Type vs Investor Type.

				<ol>
					<li>Commercial buildings are in the highest priced property types amongst all properties - and are chiefly invested by  institutional investors like government and mega corps
					<li>RCD - which are a type of residential condominimum properties are the primary focus of non-institutional buyers. - all other property type owners are interested in this type of building. We see small, large and medium investors all have purchased RCD buildings.</li
					<li>The Boston housing market is shared between institutional investors and this is followed non-investor buyers, with a notable presence of EXM properties (potentially tax-exempt or specialized buildings) owned by the government. More research is needed to understand the role of EXM building as the hold a significant market share by institutional investors </li>
					<li>Institutional investors we can categprized as mega firms, house managers, private equity companies, the trend we observe is this investors are not interested in other building types like land and industry but you find them across any form of built properties. Resulting in sustained increase in prices - notably in 2008 and 2020 the prices of house dropped due to financial crises and the covid 19 virus respectively </li>
					<li>RCD has been on a sustained increase in price </li>
					<li>Did not find any unusual data points in exploring this part of the data, some property types have low general investments </li>
