				Property Type vs Investor Type.

				<ol>
					<li>Commercial buildings are in the highest priced property types amongst all properties - and are chiefly invested by  institutional investors like government and mega corps
					<li>RCD - which are a type of residential condominimum properties are the primary focus of non-institutional buyers. - all other property type owners are interested in this type of building. We see small, large and medium investors all have purchased RCD buildings.</li
					<li>The Boston housing market is shared between institutional investors and this is followed non-investor buyers, with a notable presence of EXM properties (potentially tax-exempt or specialized buildings) owned by the government. More research is needed to understand the role of EXM building as the hold a significant market share by institutional investors </li>
					<li>Institutional investors we can categprized as mega firms, house managers, private equity companies, the trend we observe is this investors are not interested in other building types like land and industry but you find them across any form of built properties. Resulting in sustained increase in prices - notably in 2008 and 2020 the prices of house dropped due to financial crises and the covid 19 virus respectively </li>
					<li>RCD has been on a sustained increase in price </li>
					<li>Did not find any unusual data points in exploring this part of the data, some property types have low general investments </li>

			<p> The data reveals that most houses across Boston are purchased by investors rather than being owner-occupied. In the bar charts, the dark blue segments highlight properties where the buyer is not the current owner. In contrast, a few zip codes—primarily in low-income neighborhoods such as Roxbury, Mattapan, and Dorchester, which have predominantly Black demographics—show a higher proportion of homes still occupied by the original buyers. These areas appear to attract lower levels of investment, a trend that is reflected in stagnant rents and suggests a limited inflow of new capital into the city.

				Figure 4 illustrates the ratio of houses occupied by the original owners, while Figure 5 displays the distribution of investor-type purchases across various zip codes, underscoring that the majority of properties are non–investor owned. Additionally, while government entities or mega-corporations are not necessarily driving price hikes, the data indicates that non-investor buyers who purchase and flip houses significantly contribute to rising prices. This flipping activity is concentrated in a particular part of the Massachusetts area, though over the years, the trend appears to be expanding to include more zip codes..</p>

			<p> Figures 6, 7, and 8 compare how home ownership patterns have changed over time using color-coded bars to indicate whether a property is still owned by its original buyer. From 2001 to 2017, most properties across many Massachusetts cities were not retained by their buyers—suggesting frequent turnover or flipping. However, after 2017, we see a noticeable shift: more houses are bought and held by the same owners. This trend is spreading across various Boston zip codes, with both small and large non-investor buyers increasingly retaining ownership.

				To delve deeper, we added a marker (with a value of “1”) to flag properties that were flipped. The data reveals that, over time, non-investors are more frequently purchasing homes with the intent to flip them for a higher resale profit. This trend is supported by the price difference analysis presented in Figure 3. Overall, these patterns suggest that earlier in the period, homes were primarily owned by individuals who maintained ownership, whereas recent years have seen a surge in investor activity focused on flipping properties.</p>

			<h2>Summary</h2>

			<p>The analysis of Boston housing data reveals several key trends regarding ownership, investment activity, and affordability: Across Boston, most properties are purchased by non-investors (large, small and medium orgs) rather than being owner-occupied. Bar charts highlight this through dark blue segments indicating cases where the buyer is not the current owner in fig 4.
				<ul>
				<li> Regional Variations:
				In low-income neighborhoods such as Roxbury, Mattapan, and Dorchester—areas with predominantly Black demographics—a higher proportion of homes remain occupied by the original buyers. This suggests lower investment levels and stagnant rents, pointing to limited inflow of new capital in these areas.</li>
				<li> Flipping Activity:
				While large institutions like government and mega-corporations are not the primary drivers of price hikes, non-investor buyers who flip houses are contributing significantly to rising prices. This flipping activity, initially concentrated in specific regions, has gradually spread across more zip codes over time.</li>
				<li> Temporal Shifts in Ownership Patterns:
				Analysis from 2001 to 2017 shows that properties were frequently flipped, with buyers not retaining ownership. However, after 2017, there is a noticeable shift toward increased owner retention. This change is reinforced by markers indicating flipped properties and supported by the observed price differences, suggesting that non-investors are increasingly engaging in flipping homes for resale profit.</li></p>
