			<h2>Reading & Critique</h2>

			<p> In an <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/01/06/opinion/omicron-covid-us.html?unlocked_article_code=1.zk4.stTQ.3bTjWtsFU-ls&amp;smid=url-share">
				opinion article, </a> epidemiologist Jeffrey Shaman presents findings on the spread of the Omicron variant in the United States. Key claims include the seasonal surge of COVID-19 cases around late December and early January, Omicron’s faster transmission rate compared to previous variants, its ability to reinfect vaccinated or previously infected individuals, and its lower hospitalization rates. While we do not have direct access to the specific dataset used, we assume the findings reflect data captured during Omicron’s peak.

			</p>

			<p>
				This report critiques the visualization accompanying Shaman’s article and proposes alternative designs. The goal is to effectively communicate Omicron’s rapid spread, its comparative dominance over other variants, and additional contextual factors (e.g., severity, hospitalization rates) that the original visualization omits.

			<h3><strong>Critique of the Original Visualization</strong></h3>

			<p>The visualization effectively illustrates the spread of COVID-19 across different months from January to December, covering the years 2020 to 2022. It clearly shows the rise and fall of reported cases, highlighting significant peaks in January 2021 and January 2022. Listed below are other significant preceptive insights drawn from the visualization. </p>

			<p><strong>Strength of the Visualization</strong></p>

			<ul>
					<li><em>Wide Coverage: </em> The spiral visualization shows the rise and fall of reported cases over a multi-year timeline (2020–2022), highlighting major peaks in January 2021 and January 2022.</li>
					<li><em>Engaging Aesthetic: </em> The spiral, wavy lines represent growth and decline in transmission intuitively; the organic shape invites closer inspection.</li>
					<li><em>Color Contrast:</em>  Color choices stand out clearly against the background, helping viewers track the progression of the curves without distraction.</li>
					<li><em> Focus on Trends:</em>  By displaying time and a single variant dimension (implicitly Omicron), the visualization keeps things simple. </li>
			</ul>


			<p><strong> Critques of the Visualization</strong> </p>

			<ul>
				<li>
					<strong> No Clear Magnitude Encoding: </strong>
					The visualization lacks any quantitative measure of case counts. It relies on the thickness or spacing of wavy lines, which can be misleading and prone to overestimation bias. Precise comparisons between years or variants become difficult.
					<li> <strong> Limited Variant Differentiation:</strong>
					The article emphasizes Omicron’s dominance over earlier variants, but the visualization does not distinguish Omicron from other variants. Color or other visual encodings could have highlighted how Omicron compares with, for instance, Delta or Alpha.</li>
					<li> <strong> Missing Context on Severity:</strong>
					While Shaman mentions lower hospitalization rates for Omicron, no data on hospitalizations, recovery, or vaccination effectiveness are shown. This omission makes it hard to gauge Omicron’s true impact.</li>
					<li> <strong> Potential for Misinterpretation</strong>
					The mesmerizing spiral shape, though striking, may overshadow the need for clarity and detailed interpretation, particularly regarding case counts and relative variant prevalence</li>

				</li>
			</ul>

			<h2>Visualization Sketches</h2>
			<p>To address these critiques, I developed three alternative sketches. Each aims to reveal Omicron’s progression and dominant share of infections while incorporating relevant context.</p>

      <figure>

				<figcaption>
				<em>Visualizing the Rise of Omicron and Delta Variants Over Time.</em>
				</figcaption>
			</figure>

			<h3>
				<strong>Design Rationale for Sketch 1:</strong>
			</h3>

			<ul>

				<li> Line Thickness = Case Magnitude: A thicker line indicates higher reported cases over time..</li>
				<li> Color Encoding = Variant Type: Different colors (e.g., pink for Omicron, blue for Delta, etc.) highlight which variant is most prominent in a given time window..</li>
				<li> Maintaining the Spiral: Preserves the original visualization’s appealing spiral aesthetic and time orientation from January to December..</li>


			</ul>

				<h4><em>Advantages </em> </h4>

					<ul>
						<li> Visual continuity with the original design.</li>
						<li> Emphasizes Omicron’s dominance if it appears significantly thicker or more frequently than other variants.</li>
						<li> Potentially retains the attention-grabbing, “organic” shape.</li>

					</ul>

				<h4><em> Limitations </em></h4>
						<ul>
							<li> Still reliant on approximate judgments of thickness.</li>
							<li> Harder to compare exact case counts or hospitalization rates if the viewer wants detailed numeric insights.</li>
						</ul>

				<em> Violin Charts Visualizing the Spread and Dominance of COVID-19 Variants Over Time</em>
				</figcaption>
			</figure>

			<h3>
				<strong><em>Design Rationale for Sketch 2</em></strong>:
			</h3>

			<ul>
				<li> Violin Plot for Each Variant: Shows distribution of daily (or weekly) case counts for Omicron, Delta, and others over a time axis.</li>
				<li> Comparison of Peaks: Peak widths or “bulges” in the violin plot highlight when a variant had more cases.</li>
				<li> Captures Multiple Variables: Time, variant category, and spread of case counts.</li>

			</ul>

			<h4><em>Advantages </em> </h4>

					<ul>
						<li> Quickly identifies which variant peaks earlier or more frequently.</li>
						<li> Highlights overlapping timeframes for variants (e.g., Omicron vs. Delta) </li>

					</ul>

				<h4><em> Limitations </em></h4>
						<ul>
							<li> May feel less intuitive for general audiences unfamiliar with violin plots.</li>
							<li> More suitable for academic or research settings.</li>
						</ul>

				<em>Visualizing COVID-19 Variant Growth – Color Encodes Variants, Size Represents Case Magnitude.</em>
				</figcaption>
			</figure>

			<h3>
				<strong><em>Rationale for Sketch 3:</em></strong>
			</h3>

				<ul>
					<li> Circle Size = Case Magnitude
					<li> Color = Variant </li>
					<li> Linear Timeline: Each month or week displayed horizontally, with large circles denoting spikes.</li>
				</ul>

				<h4><em>Advantages </em> </h4>

				<ul>
					<li> Straightforward interpretation: bigger circles mean more cases, and color quickly indicates the dominant variant in any given period.</li>
					<li> Easier to layer on additional data (e.g., hospitalization rates could be another circle series or color shade).</li>

				</ul>

			<h4><em> Limitations </em></h4>
					<ul>
						<li> Overlapping data points can become cluttered.</li>
						<li>Still requires careful scaling to avoid misinterpretation of circle size (Stevens’ Power Law considerations).</li>
					</ul>

			<h2>Design Process & Design Decisions</h2>

			<p>
				<b>Dataset Analysis</b><br>
				The design process commenced with a thorough analysis of the dataset, utilizing Python for exploratory data analysis.
				Key functions like <code>df.head()</code>, <code>df.info()</code>, and <code>df.describe()</code> helped uncover
				the dataset’s structure, revealing patterns and potential inconsistencies.
			</p>

			<p>
				A notable aspect was the daily patient flux over 2020–2021, which capture some trends in the number of test conducted, number of cases confirmed,
				recoveries, and death. I was particularly interested in visualizing the relationship between recoveries and confirmed cases — a metric I termed <strong> recovery rate</strong>, calculated as:

			</p>

			<p>
					<strong> Recovery Rate = (Recovered Patients) / (Confirmed Patients)</strong>
			</p>

			<p>
				This metric, generally ranging from 0 to 1, indicated recovery success. Occasionally, recovery rates exceeded 1,
				suggesting data backlogs or improvements in treatment. Recognizing these patterns was essential for understanding the pandemic's progression.
			</p>

			<p>
				<b>Visualization Approach & Human-Centered Design</b><br>
				For visualization, I aimed for an intuitive and empathetic approach. Rather than using standard bar charts or line graphs,
				I opted for an <em> isotype graph </em>, featuring human icons to represent data, effectively humanizing the statistics. Initially, I explored Tableau for visualization, but Python’s scripting offered greater flexibility for customization,
				particularly for creating the isotype graph.
			</p>

			<p>
				The final visualization successfully captures recovery trends while maintaining a human-centered perspective,
				ensuring that the data remains accessible and engaging.
			</p>




      <h3>Reflection</h3>

		<p>
			Choosing how best to visualize a multi-faceted dataset is challenging. Initially, the original spiral seemed adequate at a glance—its aesthetic resonates with the notion of viral spread.
			However, applying principles from class (e.g., pre-attentive processing, signal detection, and color encoding) revealed opportunities to make the data more accessible and meaningful.
		</p>

		<ul>
		<strong> Key Takeaways </strong>

				<li> Trade-Offs: Every design choice—be it spiral lines, violin plots, or isotype charts—balances clarity with visual engagement.</li>
				<li> Context Is Crucial: Without data on hospitalization rates or variant comparisons, viewers cannot fully appreciate Omicron’s distinct role.</li>
				<li> Less Is More: Attempting to encode too many variables (e.g., case counts, hospitalizations, variants, recoveries) in one graphic can obscure rather than illuminate.</li>
				<li> Iterative Process: Sketching multiple designs fosters innovation, ensuring the final output meets both informational and aesthetic goals.</li>

		</ul>

		<p>Ultimately, no single visualization captures every angle of a complex issue like COVID-19. The art of data visualization lies in choosing what to highlight and encoding it in a way that resonates with the intended audience. By critiquing the original spiral and experimenting with variants, this report underscores the importance of deliberate, human-centered design in effectively communicating public health data.</p>
